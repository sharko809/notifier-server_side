# notifier-server_side
This is also one of my first apps written in Java. Actually I really used this app for a long time. The idea of this app is to pop up a notification sent from android device on my desktop, where this app runs. This also is supported by loud lound making everyone at my place to hear this notificaion :) I found this app very usefull when a had a tendence to forget a lot of things at home (including my cell phone).

Even if this app is useless to you (which is more likely ;)) I hope you find it's idea pretty usefull.

I'll upload client side (android) some time later.
